## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

PyAXBPS includes classes that enable reprocessing the following air-launched single-use probes from raw audio (WAV) files:

* Airborne eXpendable BathyThermograph (AXBTs)
* Airborne eXpendable Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (AXCTDs)
* Airborne eXpendable Current Profiler (AXCPs) 

Additionally, PyAXBPS includes fileinteraction, with functions that allow users to save profile data in a variety of common formats (including .DTA, .edf, and .nvo).


###Examples:

Example code using PyAXBPS to reprocess data from all three probe types and save the processed profiles in a variety of file formats is included in the example.py file.

	
### Installation Dependencies:
The recommended method for installation is via pip:
`pip install PyAXBPS`

If you would prefer to clone this repository and install manually, follow the steps below:

1. `git clone https://github.com/cdens/PyAXBPS`
2. `pip install -e PyAXBPS`
